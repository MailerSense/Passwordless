# Adding Users

Both the cloud and self-hosted versions of Rybbit support adding users to your organization.

<Steps>
### 1. Account creation

Have your user (or you for them) sign up for an account with their email address. Skip creating a organization, since you will be adding them to your existing organization.

### 2. Add the user to your organization

Go to https://app.rybbit.io/organization (replace domain with your own if self-hosted) on your admin account and click the "Add Member" button in the top right.

### 3. Select the user's role
 
You can either make the user an admin or a member. 

**Admins** can invite other users, add websites, edit websites, delete websites, and see all website data.

**Members** can see all website data, but they cannot edit anything.
