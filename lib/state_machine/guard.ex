  Guards are functions that help to decide whether it's allowed to proceed with Event
  or Transition. They might serve different purposes:

  * Preventing a state machine from getting into a state unless some criteria met
  * Creating event with multiple target states with a single source state

  Guards should not have any side-effects, cause they are getting run no matter
  if transition is successful or not, and also to determine the list of possible events
  for a certain state.
